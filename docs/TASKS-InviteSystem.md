   - `feature/invite-email`
2. Merge into development for testing
3. Final merge to main when complete

## Current Implementation

### Database Schema

- UUID primary key
- Organization reference
- Email address
- Role assignment
- Status tracking (pending/accepted/expired/revoked)
- Expiration date (7 days)
- Created/Updated timestamps
- Soft delete support

### Security Features
✅ Row Level Security (RLS) policies:
- Only admins can create invitations
- Only admins can view all organization invitations
- Users can only view invitations for their email
- One active invitation per email per organization

### Backend Functions
✅ `send_invitation`:
- Creates invitation record
- Validates admin permissions
- Handles duplicate invitations
- Sets expiration date

✅ `validate_invite_by_email`:
- Checks for valid pending invitation
- Verifies email matches
- Validates expiration
- Returns organization details

✅ `accept_invitation`:
- Updates invitation status
- Associates user with organization
- Assigns correct role
- Handles edge cases (expired/revoked)

### Frontend Components
✅ Admin Interface (`/admin/invites`):
- Create new invitations
- View pending invitations
- Revoke invitations
- Track invitation status

✅ Registration Flow:
- Team registration (`/auth/team/register`)
- Customer registration (`/auth/customer/register`)

- Automatic organization association
- Role assignment
- Dashboard redirection

## Planned Enhancements

   - Enter invited email
   - Verify organization association
   - Check role assignment

## Known Limitations
1. No email notifications (planned)
2. No bulk invite feature
3. Basic invitation management UI
4. Limited invitation analytics

## Best Practices
1. Regular cleanup of expired invitations
