# File Viewer Implementation Progress Report
Date: 2025-01-24

## Overview
We've implemented an in-page file viewer for ticket attachments, improving the user experience by allowing users to view files directly within the application instead of downloading them or opening them in new windows.

## Completed Features

### File Viewer Component
- [x] Modal-based viewer for ticket attachments
- [x] Support for multiple file types:
  - Images: Direct preview
  - PDFs: Embedded viewer
  - Text files: Embedded viewer
  - Other files: Download prompt
- [x] File actions:
  - Download button
  - Open in new tab
  - Close viewer
- [x] Loading states and error handling
- [x] Responsive design

### Ticket Details Page Updates
- [x] Grid layout for attachments
- [x] Clickable attachment cards
- [x] Human-readable file sizes
- [x] Improved visual feedback
- [x] Integration with Supabase storage

### Utilities
- [x] File size formatting function
- [x] File type detection
- [x] Secure file URL generation

## Next Steps

### Short Term
1. Add preview support for more file types:
   - Code files with syntax highlighting
   - Audio/video files
   - Office documents (if possible)
2. Improve error handling:
   - Better error messages
   - Retry mechanisms
   - Fallback options
3. Add file management features:
   - Delete attachments
   - Rename files
   - Move files between tickets

### Medium Term
1. Implement file organization:
   - Categories/tags for attachments
   - Folders/groups
   - Search functionality
2. Add collaboration features:
   - File comments
   - Version history
   - Share links

### Long Term

## Technical Debt
- Need to implement proper caching for frequently accessed files
- Consider implementing lazy loading for large file lists
- Add comprehensive error tracking
- Implement file type validation on the server side

## Security Considerations
- Ensure proper file access permissions
- Implement virus scanning
- Add file size limits
- Set up proper CORS policies

## Documentation Needed
- API documentation for file handling
- User guide for file viewer
- Security best practices
- Performance optimization guide
